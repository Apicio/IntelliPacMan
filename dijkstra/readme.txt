.java files are programs
test.java is just a skeleton program to invoke other programs
.txt files are sample graphs, in various formats
graph.java, graphLinkedList.java are adjacency matrix
   and adjacency List programs: they create graphs from files:
   can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted
randomgraph.java, randomgraphLinkedList.java create
   random graphs. For now, they only create undirected, unweighted
   graphs.
